# YOLOV3-for-Android
This repository contains an implementation of YOLOV3 models to be deployed on Android based mobile devices. The following are the steps to follow when you use the repo.

1. Train YOLOV3 model using your custom dataset for your problem domain
2. convert the weight file of yolov3 into .bp file which is the format used by tensorflow android api 
3. download the repo as .zip file into your computer and link the path of the folder to the android SDK

I have included in this repo a .ipynb file which shows you the steps to follow during training the yolov3 model and converting the model into .bp file
